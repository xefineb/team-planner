# Team Topologies Planner

> 🧪 **Experiment**: This entire application was built as an experiment using **Velocity**, exploring the capabilities of AI-assisted software development.

## What is this?

**Team Topologies Planner** is a visual, interactive tool designed to help organizations design and visualize their team structures according to the [Team Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/) framework.

It allows you to map out your organization's cognitive load, interactions, and value streams in a way that static diagrams cannot.

## Key Features

-   **Team Management**: Create and organize teams based on the four fundamental topologies:
    -   🟡 **Stream-Aligned**
    -   🟣 **Enabling**
    -   🟠 **Complicated Subsystem**
    -   🔵 **Platform**
-   **Visual Topology View**: A dynamic, drag-and-drop diagram to visualize team relationships.
-   **Interaction Modeling**: Define interaction modes between teams (Collaboration, X-as-a-Service, Facilitation).
-   **Value Stream Mapping**: Create value streams with custom icons (💰, 🛒, etc.) and assign teams to them to visualize flow.
-   **Export & Import**: Save your organization design to a local file and share it with others.
-   **Compact & Grid Views**: Toggle between high-level overviews and detailed team breakdowns.

## How it was built

This project serves as a demonstration of modern AI coding capabilities. It was iteratively designed, refactored, and polished through a conversation with Velocity, moving from a basic concept to a fully functional, styled application with complex features like SVG visualization and data persistence.
